# nyt_api_integration
This project provides a service to query books recommended by the New York Times, allowing genre-based searches. The backend is built with FastAPI using in-memory storage, while the frontend uses React and TypeScript. It includes unit tests, execution logs, and sequence diagrams for future Amazon and O'Reilly integrations.
